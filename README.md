# BetterAudit

## Developers

This is a side project created by:
Ken Linzmeier (GIT: KenLinz) (EMAIL: keli1246@colorado.edu)
Alyssa Webb (GIT: Alyssa-Webb) (EMAIL: alwe1021@colorado.edu)

## Description

BetterAudit is our attempt at revising the "Degree Audit" feature that CU Boulder offers in a way that is easier to understand, as we have heard many complaints about the current system. Currently, we are only implementing this for the Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science degree, however, if enough people are interested we are also interested in incorporating more degrees.

## Vision Statement

The goal of BetterAudit is to enable students to have ease of access to their progress throughout their college journey. 

## Outline

SourceCode - Contains the Code for the site
    init_data - Contains Database Initialization Code (SQL)
    views - Contains Webpages, Partials, Layouts, and Resources

## How to run?

Currently, the only way to run our site is through Docker and composing to run it locally on your computer. When we have finished and fleshed out the Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science degree, we will host the site to the cloud to make it more accessible to users!
